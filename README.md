Disable Jetpack Carousel on Mobile
======================

A WordPress plugin that disables Jetpack Carousel on mobile devices.

Purpose
-------

[Carousel](http://jetpack.me/support/carousel/) is a fantastic gallery lightbox feature included with the [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) plugin. It's not perfect on all mobile devices so you may want to disable it specifically for mobile users. That's what this plugin does.

This plugin also works with [Gallery Carousel Without JetPack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/carousel-without-jetpack/).

Device Detection
----------------

The popular [Mobile_Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) PHP class handles device detection. It will be updated regularly in this plugin.
