Disables Jetpack Carousel on mobile devices.

== Description ==

[Carousel](http://jetpack.me/support/carousel/) is a fantastic gallery lightbox feature included with the [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) plugin. It's not perfect on all mobile devices so you may want to disable it specifically for mobile users. That's what this plugin does.

This plugin also works with [Gallery Carousel Without JetPack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/carousel-without-jetpack/).

**Device Detection**: The popular [Mobile_Detect](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect) PHP class handles device detection. It will be updated regularly in this plugin.

You can follow on [GitHub](https://github.com/stevengliebe/disable-carousel-mobile).

== Installation ==

Please see [Installing Plugins](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) in the WordPress Codex.

No configuration is necessary. Just install then activate and Carousel will be disabled automatically for mobile users.

== Changelog ==
